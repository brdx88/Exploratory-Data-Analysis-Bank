# Exploratory Data Analysis of the Bank
The following is the result of Exploratory Data Analysis by Brian Ivan Cusuanto regarding customer data who moved and did not.
## Problems:
  1. What is the reason why the customer wants to stop saving at the bank concerned?
  2. Does ** CC ownership ** affect account termination?
  3. What effect does ** CreditScore ** have on account termination?
  3. Does ** Tenure ** affect the account termination?
  5. Does ** NumOfProducts ** affect account termination?

## Goals:
  1. Assessing bank services from customer loyalty.
  2. Find the reasons why customers leave for other banks.
  
## Conclusion
1. Ownership of credit cards does not affect customers moving from the bank.
    - As many as 80% of customers who have credit cards are customers who have not moved
    - 79% of customers who have credit cards, do not leave the bank
2. The duration of the loan tenor from the bank to the customer does not affect the customer to move to another bank. Whether the duration is in months or 10 years, the percentage of customers who do not move remains much larger than customers who do.
3. The age of the customer does not affect the customer to move from the bank.
4. Whether a customer is active or not, it doesn't affect the movement of the customer.
    - As many as 73% of inactive customers are proven not to have moved
    - As many as 85% of active customers are proven not to have moved
4. Credit Score influences customers to move to another bank
    - Credit scores starting with 475 and below (value 300s) tend to stop and move from this bank
    - Customers with high credit scores (above 470) tend not to leave and move from this bank.
    - only customers with credit scores of 475 and 839
    - Customers with a low credit score (below 470) tend to move from this bank
    - Reporting from [The Balance] (https://www.thebalance.com/side-effects-of-bad-credit-960383) that a low credit score makes people not have the opportunity to get other public facilities such as large loans.
5. The number of products owned by the customer affects the customer to move.
    - Customers who only have at most 2 bank products tend to stay
    - In fact, customers who have many products tend to move banks
    - 83% of customers who have 3 bank products have moved
    - and all customers who have 4 bank products have moved
  
## Recommendations
1. This bank service is good. Evidenced by the ownership of a credit card, the loan is given by the customer, age, and whether the customer is active or not; does not influence customers to move from this bank.
2. A customer who has moved to another bank is a customer whose credit score is indeed low, which means that it is not feasible to provide more services or facilities for the customer. How can customers be provided with more service if the loan responsibility is still low? So, it's normal for customers to move.
3. Customers who move to another bank are customers who have a large number of products offered by the bank. It can be said that the customer just wants to know the services and facilities that the bank has, and then the customer tends to review and compare with other banks, which bank product is right for him. Like today, these customers are just * reviewers * who are not serious about being loyal but only serious about finding out the advantages and disadvantages of each bank.
4. The bank is good, because of all the factors that customers moving to another bank are not significant and not principles, such as low credit responsibility or simply having various bank products.
